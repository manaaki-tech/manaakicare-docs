# Program Manager Role

Understand the program manager role, including organisation-wide oversight, program approvals, and strategic management capabilities.

## Overview

Program Managers oversee entire programs and have the broadest data visibility within their organisation. They share the same dashboard as Supervisors but with organisation-wide data access, enabling them to monitor all teams, services, and <Term path="referral" /> activity.

## Key Responsibilities

### Organisation-Wide Oversight
- Monitoring all <Term path="referral" plural /> requests across the organisation
- Reviewing service delivery across all teams
- Tracking organisation-wide metrics and trends
- Ensuring consistent service quality

### Program Approval
- Approving programs and service configurations
- Managing program capacity and resource allocation
- Reviewing and approving organisational processes
- Setting program-level policies

### <Term path="referral" plural /> Request Management
- Reviewing incoming <Term path="referral" /> service requests (same as Supervisors)
- Accepting or rejecting <Term path="referral" plural /> with documented reasons
- Allocating <Term path="referral" plural /> to team members across the organisation
- Prioritizing critical and urgent cases

### Strategic Management
- Analyzing performance metrics for reporting
- Resource planning and workload balancing
- Identifying service gaps and improvement opportunities
- Reporting to stakeholders

## Permissions

| Action | Permission |
|--------|------------|
| View all <Term path="referral" /> requests in organisation | Yes |
| Accept <Term path="referral" /> requests | Yes |
| Reject <Term path="referral" /> requests (with reason) | Yes |
| Allocate <Term path="referral" plural /> to team members | Yes |
| Approve programs | Yes |
| View all records in organisation | Yes |
| View all <Term path="serviceEpisode" plural /> | Yes |
| View all team <Term path="activity" plural /> | Yes |
| View <Term path="serviceUser" /> information | Yes |
| Supervise cases | Yes |
| Access settings | No (Admin only) |

## Data Visibility

Program Managers have **organisation-wide visibility**:

| Data Type | Scope |
|-----------|-------|
| <Term path="referral" plural /> requests | All services in the organisation |
| <Term path="serviceEpisode" plural /> | All <Term path="serviceEpisode" plural /> across all teams |
| <Term path="activity" plural /> | All <Term path="activity" plural /> across all <Term path="caseWorker" plural /> |
| <Term path="serviceUser" /> records | All <Term path="serviceUser" plural /> in the organisation |
| Team performance | All supervisors and <Term path="caseWorker" plural /> |

This is broader than Supervisor access, which is limited to their directly supervised staff.

### Comparison with Other Roles

| Feature | <Term path="caseWorker" /> | Supervisor | Program Manager |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Data scope** | Own records only | Own + supervised staff | Entire organisation |
| **Accept/Reject <Term path="referral" plural />** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Allocate to staff** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Approve programs** | No | No | Yes |
| **Supervise cases** | No | Yes | Yes |

## Dashboard Features

Program Managers use the same Supervisor Dashboard, which provides:

- **Analytics Overview** - Pending requests, active <Term path="serviceEpisode" plural />, <Term path="activity" plural />/<Term path="serviceEpisode" plural /> ratio, monthly <Term path="referral" plural />
- **Pending <Term path="referral" /> Requests** - Incoming requests with Accept/Reject actions
- **<Term path="serviceUser" plural /> Needing Contact** - <Term path="serviceUser" plural /> not contacted in 5+ days (across all teams)
- **Pending Service Dispatch** - <Term path="referral" plural /> awaiting service assignment (organisation-wide)

The key difference is that all data shown is **organisation-wide**, not limited to a specific team.

For detailed dashboard documentation, see [Supervisor / Program Manager Dashboard](/dashboards/supervisor).

## Workflow Overview

### Management Hierarchy

```
Admin
  └── Program Manager (organisation-wide oversight)
        └── Supervisor (team-level oversight)
              └── Case Worker (individual caseload)
```

### Program Manager Workflow

```
Monitor Organisation Metrics
  → Review Pending Referral Requests

## Best Practices

- Ensure rejection reasons are well-documented and appropriate

### Stakeholder Reporting
