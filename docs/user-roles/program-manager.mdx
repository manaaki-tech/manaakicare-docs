# Program Manager Role

Understand the program manager role, including organisation-wide oversight, program approvals, and strategic management capabilities.

## Overview

Program Managers oversee entire programs and have the broadest data visibility within their organisation. They share the same dashboard as Supervisors but with organisation-wide data access, enabling them to monitor all teams, services, and referral activity.

## Key Responsibilities

### Organisation-Wide Oversight
- Monitoring all referral requests across the organisation
- Reviewing service delivery across all teams
- Tracking organisation-wide metrics and trends
- Ensuring consistent service quality

### Program Approval
- Approving programs and service configurations
- Managing program capacity and resource allocation
- Reviewing and approving organisational processes
- Setting program-level policies

### Referral Request Management
- Reviewing incoming referral service requests (same as Supervisors)
- Accepting or rejecting referrals with documented reasons
- Allocating referrals to team members across the organisation
- Prioritizing critical and urgent cases

### Strategic Management
- Analyzing performance metrics for reporting
- Resource planning and workload balancing
- Identifying service gaps and improvement opportunities
- Reporting to stakeholders

## Permissions

| Action | Permission |
|--------|------------|
| View all referral requests in organisation | Yes |
| Accept referral requests | Yes |
| Reject referral requests (with reason) | Yes |
| Allocate referrals to team members | Yes |
| Approve programs | Yes |
| View all records in organisation | Yes |
| View all service episodes | Yes |
| View all team activities | Yes |
| View client information | Yes |
| Supervise cases | Yes |
| Access settings | No (Admin only) |

## Data Visibility

Program Managers have **organisation-wide visibility**:

| Data Type | Scope |
|-----------|-------|
| Referral requests | All services in the organisation |
| Service episodes | All episodes across all teams |
| Activities | All activities across all case workers |
| Client records | All clients in the organisation |
| Team performance | All supervisors and case workers |

This is broader than Supervisor access, which is limited to their directly supervised staff.

### Comparison with Other Roles

| Feature | Case Worker | Supervisor | Program Manager |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Data scope** | Own records only | Own + supervised staff | Entire organisation |
| **Accept/Reject referrals** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Allocate to staff** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Approve programs** | No | No | Yes |
| **Supervise cases** | No | Yes | Yes |

## Dashboard Features

Program Managers use the same Supervisor Dashboard, which provides:

- **Analytics Overview** - Pending requests, active episodes, activities/episodes ratio, monthly referrals
- **Pending Referral Requests** - Incoming requests with Accept/Reject actions
- **Service Users Needing Contact** - Clients not contacted in 5+ days (across all teams)
- **Pending Service Dispatch** - Referrals awaiting service assignment (organisation-wide)

The key difference is that all data shown is **organisation-wide**, not limited to a specific team.

For detailed dashboard documentation, see [Supervisor / Program Manager Dashboard](/dashboards/supervisor).

## Workflow Overview

### Management Hierarchy

```
Admin
  └── Program Manager (organisation-wide oversight)
        └── Supervisor (team-level oversight)
              └── Case Worker (individual caseload)
```

### Program Manager Workflow

```
Monitor Organisation Metrics
  → Review Pending Referral Requests
  → Accept & Allocate (or Reject)
  → Monitor Service Delivery
  → Track Client Engagement
  → Report to Stakeholders
```

## Best Practices

### Strategic Oversight
- Review organisation-wide analytics at the start of each day
- Monitor pending requests across all services
- Track referral trends over time using monthly referral counts

### Resource Management
- Balance workload across supervisors and teams
- Monitor the Activities / Episodes ratio to identify underperforming areas
- Ensure all services have adequate staffing

### Quality Assurance
- Review the Service Users Needing Contact section for systemic issues
- Follow up on referrals delayed in the dispatch queue
- Ensure rejection reasons are well-documented and appropriate

### Stakeholder Reporting
- Use analytics data for regular reporting
- Track referral volumes and service delivery outcomes
- Document program capacity and resource utilization
