# Case Worker Role

Understand the case worker role, including caseload management, activity recording, and service delivery responsibilities.

## Overview

Case workers are front-line staff who manage direct client relationships and service delivery. They work with assigned service episodes, record activities and case notes, and ensure clients receive timely follow-up and support. Their dashboard — **"My Caseload"** — provides a personal view of their active cases and pending follow-ups.

## Key Responsibilities

### Caseload Management
- Managing assigned service episodes from commencement to completion
- Tracking active cases and their current status
- Ensuring timely service commencement for newly assigned episodes
- Monitoring and completing service delivery

### Client Engagement
- Conducting in-person visits and telehealth sessions
- Maintaining regular contact with clients (tracked by the system)
- Building and maintaining client relationships
- Identifying and responding to client needs

### Activity Recording
- Recording all client interactions (visits, phone calls, telehealth)
- Writing case notes and documenting observations
- Setting follow-up dates for future actions
- Assessing and recording risk levels for activities

### Follow-up Management
- Tracking scheduled follow-ups via the dashboard
- Addressing overdue follow-ups promptly
- Prioritizing activities based on risk level and urgency
- Rescheduling missed interactions

### Documentation
- Maintaining accurate client records
- Uploading supporting documents
- Recording activity outcomes (completed, no-show, rescheduled, etc.)
- Keeping service episode records up to date

## Permissions

| View activities within assigned episodes | Yes |
| Create activities / case notes | Yes |
| Edit own activities (within 10 days) | Yes |

## Data Visibility

Case workers have a **personal scope** — they can only see data directly assigned to them:

| Data Type | Scope |
|-----------|-------|
| Service episodes | Only episodes where assigned as staff |
| Activities | Only activities within assigned episodes |
| Client records | Only clients linked to assigned episodes |
| Referral counts | Only referrals linked to assignments |

This means your dashboard shows only your workload, keeping the view focused and uncluttered.

### Comparison with Other Roles

| Feature | Case Worker | Supervisor | Program Manager |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Data scope** | Own records only | Own + supervised staff | Entire organisation |
| **Dashboard title** | "My Caseload" | "Supervisor Dashboard" | "Supervisor Dashboard" |
| **Key focus** | Service delivery | Team management | Organisation oversight |
| **Accept/Reject referrals** | No | Yes | Yes |

## Dashboard Features

The Case Worker Dashboard — **"My Caseload"** — provides:

- **Analytics Overview** — Active cases, urgent/crisis count, follow-ups due, total referrals
- **My Active Cases** — All service episodes assigned to you with status and actions
- **Activities Needing Follow-up** — Scheduled follow-ups sorted by date and priority, with risk level and overdue tracking

For detailed dashboard documentation, see [Case Worker Dashboard](/dashboards/case-worker).

## Workflow Overview

### Daily Workflow

```
Check Dashboard Metrics
  → Address Overdue Follow-ups (red badges)
  → Process Urgent/Crisis Items
  → Conduct Scheduled Visits & Sessions
  → Record Activities & Case Notes
  → Set Follow-up Dates
  → Review Upcoming Follow-ups
```

### Service Episode Lifecycle

```
Assigned (awaiting_commencement)
  → Active (service delivery in progress)
  → Completed / Closed / Discharged
```

## Best Practices

### Prioritization
- Check **Urgent/Crisis** count first thing each day
- Address **overdue follow-ups** (red badges) before anything else
- Process **follow-ups due today** next
- Then work through routine caseload

### Client Contact
- Maintain regular contact — your supervisor is alerted when clients aren't contacted for 5+ days
- Record every interaction as an activity
- Set follow-up dates to ensure no client falls through the cracks

### Activity Recording
- Record activities promptly after each client interaction
- Set appropriate risk levels (None, Medium, High, Critical)
- Always set a follow-up date when future action is needed
- Mark activity outcomes accurately (completed, no-show, rescheduled, etc.)

### Documentation Quality
- Write clear, concise case notes
- Include relevant observations and client feedback
- Upload supporting documents when available
- Keep service episode records current
