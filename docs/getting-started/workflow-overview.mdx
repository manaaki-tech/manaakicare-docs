## Priority Handling

Different priorities have different expected response times.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph priorities["<b>PRIORITY LEVELS</b>"]
        direction TB
        critical["🔴 Critical / Emergency"]
        urgent["🟠 Urgent"]
        priority["🟡 Priority"]
        routine["🟢 Routine"]
    end

    subgraph response["<b>EXPECTED RESPONSE</b>"]
        direction TB
        r1["Immediate - same hour"]
        r2["Same day"]
        r3["Within 24 hours"]
        r4["Within 48 hours"]
    end

    critical --> r1
    urgent --> r2
    priority --> r3
    routine --> r4

```

### Priority Guidelines

| Priority | When to Use | Example Scenarios |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Critical / Emergency** | Immediate safety concern | Child at risk, medical emergency, crisis situation |
| **Urgent** | Needs same-day attention | Family in distress, time-sensitive support needed |
| **Priority** | Important but not emergency | New client intake, scheduled assessment overdue |
| **Routine** | Standard processing | Regular check-in, administrative <Term path="referral" /> |
