# Workflow Overview

This page provides visual diagrams to help you understand how referrals and service episodes flow through ManaakiCare. These diagrams are useful for new staff orientation and understanding the end-to-end process.

## Referral Lifecycle

The complete journey of a referral from creation to service completion.

## Role Responsibilities

This diagram shows how work flows between the three main roles in ManaakiCare.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph io["<b>INTAKE OFFICER</b>"]
        io1["Create referral"]
        io2["Complete intake assessment"]
        io3["Submit for review"]
        io4["Dispatch to service"]
    end

    subgraph sup["<b>SUPERVISOR / PROGRAM MANAGER</b>"]
        sup1["Review referral"]
        sup2{"Approve?"}
        sup3["Accept service request"]
        sup4["Allocate to case worker"]
        sup5["Monitor team activity"]
    end

    subgraph cw["<b>CASE WORKER</b>"]
        cw1["Receive assignment"]
        cw2["Begin service delivery"]
        cw3["Record activities"]
        cw4["Complete follow-ups"]
        cw5["Close episode"]
    end

    io1 --> io2 --> io3

    style sup fill:#F7F0E0,stroke:#C4A35A,color:#4A3D20
    style cw fill:#E8F2EC,stroke:#5C8A72,color:#2D4A3E
```

### Role Quick Reference

| Role | Primary Responsibilities | Dashboard Focus |
|------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Intake Officer** | Create referrals, process intake, dispatch to services | New referrals, review queue, service dispatch |
| **Supervisor** | Approve/reject referrals, allocate to team, monitor contacts | Pending requests, team activity, client engagement |
| **Case Worker** | Deliver services, record activities, manage follow-ups | Active cases, follow-ups due, client interactions |

---

## Service Request Flow

When a referral is dispatched to a service, the supervisor must accept or reject it.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PendingDispatch: Referral approved

    PendingDispatch --> ServiceRequested: Intake dispatches to service
    ServiceRequested --> Accepted: Supervisor accepts
    ServiceRequested --> Rejected: Supervisor rejects

    Rejected --> PendingDispatch: Select different service

    Accepted --> EpisodeCreated: System creates episode
    EpisodeCreated --> Unassigned: No case worker selected
    EpisodeCreated --> Assigned: Case worker allocated

    Unassigned --> Assigned: Supervisor assigns later
    Assigned --> ServiceDelivery: Case worker begins work
    ServiceDelivery --> [*]: Episode completed
```

<Callout color="teal" title="Automatic Episode Creation">
When a supervisor accepts a service request, ManaakiCare automatically creates a service episode. If a case worker is selected during acceptance, they are immediately assigned and can see the episode on their dashboard.
</Callout>

## Priority Handling

Different priorities have different expected response times.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph priorities["<b>PRIORITY LEVELS</b>"]
        direction TB
        critical["🔴 Critical / Emergency"]
        urgent["🟠 Urgent"]
        priority["🟡 Priority"]
        routine["🟢 Routine"]
    end

    subgraph response["<b>EXPECTED RESPONSE</b>"]
        direction TB
        r1["Immediate - same hour"]
        r2["Same day"]
        r3["Within 24 hours"]
        r4["Within 48 hours"]
    end

    critical --> r1
    urgent --> r2
    priority --> r3
    routine --> r4

    style critical fill:#F5E6E0,stroke:#B85C38,color:#5C2E1A
    style urgent fill:#F7F0E0,stroke:#C4A35A,color:#4A3D20
    style priority fill:#F7F0E0,stroke:#C4A35A,color:#4A3D20
    style routine fill:#E8F2EC,stroke:#5C8A72,color:#2D4A3E
```

### Priority Guidelines

| Priority | When to Use | Example Scenarios |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Critical / Emergency** | Immediate safety concern | Child at risk, medical emergency, crisis situation |
| **Urgent** | Needs same-day attention | Family in distress, time-sensitive support needed |
| **Priority** | Important but not emergency | New client intake, scheduled assessment overdue |
| **Routine** | Standard processing | Regular check-in, administrative referral |
