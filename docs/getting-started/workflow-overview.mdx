# Workflow Overview

This page provides visual diagrams to help you understand how referrals and service episodes flow through Manaaki Central. These diagrams are useful for new staff orientation and understanding the end-to-end process.

## Referral Lifecycle

The complete journey of a referral from creation to service completion.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph intake["<b>INTAKE PHASE</b>"]
        draft["📝 Draft"]
        submitted["📤 Submitted"]
        pending_review["⏳ Pending Review"]
    end

    subgraph approval["<b>APPROVAL PHASE</b>"]
        pending_service["📋 Pending Service Review"]
        rejected["❌ Rejected"]
    end

    subgraph delivery["<b>SERVICE DELIVERY PHASE</b>"]
        awaiting["🕐 Awaiting Service"]
        active["✅ Active"]
        completed["🎉 Completed"]
    end

    draft -->|"Intake Officer submits"| submitted
    submitted -->|"Auto-progress"| pending_review
    pending_review -->|"Supervisor approves"| pending_service
    pending_review -->|"Supervisor rejects"| rejected
    rejected -->|"Resubmit with changes"| pending_review
    pending_service -->|"Dispatch to service"| awaiting
    awaiting -->|"Case Worker begins"| active
    active -->|"Service complete"| completed

```

## Role Responsibilities

This diagram shows how work flows between the three main roles in ManaakiCare.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph io["<b>INTAKE OFFICER</b>"]
        io1["Create referral"]
        io2["Complete intake assessment"]
        io3["Submit for review"]
        io4["Dispatch to service"]
    end

    subgraph sup["<b>SUPERVISOR / PROGRAM MANAGER</b>"]
        sup1["Review referral"]
        sup2{"Approve?"}
        sup3["Accept service request"]
        sup4["Allocate to case worker"]
        sup5["Monitor team activity"]
    end

    subgraph cw["<b>CASE WORKER</b>"]
        cw1["Receive assignment"]
        cw2["Begin service delivery"]
        cw3["Record activities"]
        cw4["Complete follow-ups"]
        cw5["Close episode"]
    end

    io1 --> io2 --> io3
    io3 --> sup1
    sup1 --> sup2
    sup2 -->|"Yes"| io4
    sup2 -->|"No"| io3
    io4 --> sup3
    sup3 --> sup4
    sup4 --> cw1
    cw1 --> cw2 --> cw3 --> cw4
    cw4 --> cw5
    sup5 -.->|"Oversight"| cw3
    sup5 -.->|"Oversight"| cw4

```

### Role Quick Reference

| Role | Primary Responsibilities | Dashboard Focus |
|------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Intake Officer** | Create referrals, process intake, dispatch to services | New referrals, review queue, service dispatch |
| **Supervisor** | Approve/reject referrals, allocate to team, monitor contacts | Pending requests, team activity, client engagement |
| **Case Worker** | Deliver services, record activities, manage follow-ups | Active cases, follow-ups due, client interactions |

---

## Service Request Flow

When a referral is dispatched to a service, the supervisor must accept or reject it.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PendingDispatch: Referral approved

    PendingDispatch --> ServiceRequested: Intake dispatches to service
    ServiceRequested --> Accepted: Supervisor accepts
    ServiceRequested --> Rejected: Supervisor rejects

    Rejected --> PendingDispatch: Select different service

    Accepted --> EpisodeCreated: System creates episode
    EpisodeCreated --> Unassigned: No case worker selected
    EpisodeCreated --> Assigned: Case worker allocated

    Unassigned --> Assigned: Supervisor assigns later
    Assigned --> ServiceDelivery: Case worker begins work
    ServiceDelivery --> [*]: Episode completed
```

<Callout color="teal" title="Automatic Episode Creation">
When a supervisor accepts a service request, Manaaki Central automatically creates a service episode. If a case worker is selected during acceptance, they are immediately assigned and can see the episode on their dashboard.
</Callout>

## Priority Handling

Different priorities have different expected response times.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph priorities["<b>PRIORITY LEVELS</b>"]
        direction TB
        critical["🔴 Critical / Emergency"]
        urgent["🟠 Urgent"]
        priority["🟡 Priority"]
        routine["🟢 Routine"]
    end

    subgraph response["<b>EXPECTED RESPONSE</b>"]
        direction TB
        r1["Immediate - same hour"]
        r2["Same day"]
        r3["Within 24 hours"]
        r4["Within 48 hours"]
    end

    critical --> r1
    urgent --> r2
    priority --> r3
    routine --> r4

```

### Priority Guidelines

| Priority | When to Use | Example Scenarios |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Critical / Emergency** | Immediate safety concern | Child at risk, medical emergency, crisis situation |
| **Urgent** | Needs same-day attention | Family in distress, time-sensitive support needed |
| **Priority** | Important but not emergency | New client intake, scheduled assessment overdue |
| **Routine** | Standard processing | Regular check-in, administrative referral |

Understanding who can see what in Manaaki Central.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph admin["<b>ADMIN / PROGRAM MANAGER</b>"]
        a1["All records in organisation"]
    end

    subgraph supervisor["<b>SUPERVISOR</b>"]
        s1["Own records"]
        s2["Supervised case workers' records"]
    end

    subgraph caseworker["<b>CASE WORKER</b>"]
        c1["Only own assigned cases"]
    end

    admin --> supervisor
    supervisor --> caseworker

```

| Role | Can View | Cannot View |

| **Case Worker** | Own assigned service episodes and activities | Other case workers' cases |
| **Supervisor** | Own records + all supervised case workers' records | Records outside their team |
