# Supervisor / Program Manager Dashboard

The Supervisor Dashboard is your central hub for managing <Term path="referral" /> requests, monitoring team <Term path="activity" />, and ensuring timely service delivery. Both Supervisors and Program Managers share the same dashboard experience.

## Overview

![Supervisor Dashboard Analytics](/supervisor/dashboard/analytic.png)

The Supervisor Dashboard displays:
- **Real-time analytics** showing pending requests, active episodes, and <Term path="referral" /> volumes
- **Pending <Term path="referral" plural /> Requests** queue for accepting or rejecting incoming <Term path="referral" plural />
- **<Term path="serviceUser" plural /> Needing Contact** to flag clients not contacted recently
- **Pending Service Dispatch** for <Term path="referral" plural /> awaiting service assignment

The dashboard description reads: *"Review <Term path="referral" plural />, allocate to team members, and monitor <Term path="serviceUser" /> engagement."*

---

## Analytics Section

The top section displays four key metric cards that give you an at-a-glance view of your workload.

### Statistics Cards

| Card | Icon | Description | What It Shows |
|------|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Pending Requests** | Document | <Term path="referral" /> requests awaiting your action | Count of incoming requests needing accept/reject |
| **Active <Term path="serviceEpisode" plural />** | People | Active <Term path="serviceEpisode" plural /> under your oversight | Total active service delivery episodes |
| **<Term path="activity" plural /> / <Term path="serviceEpisode" plural />** | Activity | <Term path="activity" /> engagement ratio | Format: "X/Y" (total <Term path="activity" plural /> / unique episodes with <Term path="activity" plural />) |
| **<Term path="referral" plural /> (This Month)** | Clock | <Term path="referral" plural /> created in the current month | Monthly <Term path="referral" /> volume |

### Understanding the Cards

- **Orange highlight** on "Pending Requests" indicates items requiring your immediate attention
- The **<Term path="activity" plural /> / <Term path="serviceEpisode" plural />** ratio helps you gauge team engagement - a higher ratio means more <Term path="activity" plural /> per episode
- Numbers update in real-time as your team processes <Term path="referral" plural /> and records <Term path="activity" plural />

## Pending <Term path="referral" plural /> Requests

![Pending Referral Requests](/supervisor/dashboard/pending_referral_service_request.png)

This full-width section displays all incoming <Term path="referral" /> requests that require your review. These are <Term path="referral" plural /> that have been dispatched to a service you supervise and need to be accepted or rejected.

**Section description:** *"Review and allocate incoming <Term path="referral" /> requests to your team."*

### Table Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Client** | Client name and phone number |
| **Service** | The service being requested (displayed as a badge) |
| **Reference** | <Term path="referral" /> reference number (e.g., REF-2026-DEFAULT-00045) |
| **Start Date** | Requested service start date |
| **Actions** | Accept and Reject buttons |

### Accepting a <Term path="referral" /> {#accepting-a-referral}

When you click **Accept**, a dialog appears with the following options:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Allocate to Team Member** | Optional | Dropdown to assign the <Term path="referral" /> to a specific staff member from your team |
| **Notes for Team Member** | Optional | Free-text instructions or context for the allocated worker |

After accepting:
1. The <Term path="referral" /> service request status changes to **Accepted**
2. A **<Term path="serviceEpisode" />** is automatically created for the client under the requested service
3. If a team member is selected in the "Allocate to Team Member" dropdown:
   - The selected <Term path="caseWorker" /> is **assigned to the service episode** as staff
   - A **"<Term path="referral" /> and Service Enrolment"** <Term path="activity" /> is automatically created within the episode, containing the <Term path="referral" /> summary, service details, and staff assignment
   - The <Term path="caseWorker" /> will see this episode appear on their [Case Worker Dashboard](/dashboards/case-worker) under **My Active <Term path="cases" />**
4. Notes provided in the "Notes for Team Member" field are included in the enrolment <Term path="activity" /> for the <Term path="caseWorker" />'s reference
5. The <Term path="referral" /> progresses forward in the workflow

<Callout color="teal" title="Service Episode Creation">
Every accepted <Term path="referral" /> request creates a <Term path="serviceEpisode" />. Selecting a team member ensures the <Term path="caseWorker" /> is immediately assigned and can begin service delivery. If no team member is selected, the episode is created but will need staff assignment later.
</Callout>

### Rejecting a <Term path="referral" /> {#rejecting-a-referral}

When you click **Reject**, a dialog requires:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Reason for Rejection** | **Yes** | You must provide an explanation for the rejection |

After rejecting:
1. The <Term path="referral" /> service request status changes to **Rejected** with the reason recorded
2. The <Term path="referral" /> status reverts to **Pending Service Dispatch**
3. The <Term path="referral" /> reappears in the [Pending Service Dispatch](#pending-service-dispatch) section (on the intake officer's or dispatching user's view)
4. A new service must be selected and a new service request created before the <Term path="referral" /> can proceed again

<Callout color="amber" title="Rejection Reason Required">
You cannot submit a rejection without providing a reason. This ensures transparency and helps the referring team understand the decision. After rejection, the <Term path="referral" /> goes back to pending service dispatch where a different service can be selected and a new request submitted.
</Callout>

### Search and Pagination

- Use the search bar to filter by **client name** or **service name**
- Results filter automatically as you type
- Pagination controls show at the bottom: "Showing X-Y of Z" with page navigation

### Empty State

When there are no pending requests, you will see a green checkmark with the message: *"All caught up! No pending <Term path="referral" plural /> to allocate."*

## <Term path="serviceUser" plural /> Needing Contact {#service-users-needing-contact}

![Service Users Needing Contact and Pending Service Dispatch](/supervisor/dashboard/service_needing_contact_and_pending_service_dispatch.png)

This section (left column) flags <Term path="serviceUser" plural /> who have not been contacted by their assigned <Term path="caseWorker" /> in **5 or more days**. It helps supervisors ensure <Term path="serviceUser" plural /> receive timely follow-up.

**Section description:** *"Clients not contacted in 5+ days"*

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Client** | Client name and phone number |
| **<Term path="caseWorker" />** | The <Term path="caseWorker" /> assigned to this client |
| **Days** | Number of days since last contact (displayed as a badge) |

### Days Badge Colours

| Colour | Condition | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Red** | More than 7 days | Overdue - requires immediate follow-up |
| **Grey** | 5-7 days | Approaching overdue - monitor closely |
| **--** | No contact recorded | No contact history available |

### How Contact Is Tracked

The system tracks the most recent <Term path="activity" /> where:
- The <Term path="activity" /> outcome is marked as **completed**
- The <Term path="activity" /> type is a **telehealth session** or **in-person visit**

### What You Can Do

1. Review <Term path="serviceUser" plural /> flagged for follow-up
2. Search by **client name** or **<Term path="caseWorker" /> name**
3. Follow up with <Term path="caseWorker" plural /> who have overdue contacts
4. Ensure no <Term path="serviceUser" /> falls through the cracks

<Callout color="teal" title="Proactive Monitoring">
Check this section daily to ensure your team maintains regular contact with all <Term path="serviceUser" plural />. Early intervention prevents disengagement.
</Callout>

## Pending Service Dispatch

This section (right column) shows <Term path="referral" plural /> where the **service request has been accepted** by a supervisor/manager but **no <Term path="caseWorker" /> has been assigned yet**. A <Term path="serviceEpisode" /> has been created, but it still needs a <Term path="caseWorker" /> allocated to begin service delivery.

**Section description:** *"<Term path="referral" plural /> awaiting service assignment"*

### Why <Term path="referral" plural /> Appear Here

A <Term path="referral" /> appears in this section when:
- The service request was **accepted** by a supervisor/manager
- **No <Term path="caseWorker" /> was selected** during the acceptance step (the "Allocate to Team Member" field was left empty)
- The <Term path="serviceEpisode" /> exists but has no staff assigned

### Table Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Client** | Client name and <Term path="referral" /> reference number |
| **Priority** | Priority level badge |
| **Date** | <Term path="referral" /> date |

### Priority Badges

| Badge | Colour | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Routine** | Green | Standard processing timeline |
| **Priority** | Amber/Orange | Requires prompt attention |
| **Urgent** | Orange | Requires immediate action |
| **Critical** | Red | Crisis situation - highest urgency |

### Search

Use the search bar to filter by **client name** or **priority level**.

### What You Can Do

1. Identify accepted <Term path="referral" plural /> that still need a <Term path="caseWorker" /> assigned
2. Prioritise urgent and critical <Term path="referral" plural /> for faster allocation
3. Assign a <Term path="caseWorker" /> to the <Term path="serviceEpisode" /> to begin service delivery
4. Track any <Term path="referral" plural /> that have been waiting too long without staff assignment

## <Term path="referral" /> Request Workflow

### Status Flow for Service Requests

```
Pending → Accepted → Service Episode Created → Case Worker Assigned → Service Delivery
         → Rejected (with reason)
```

### What Happens on Accept

1. Service request status changes to **Accepted**
2. A **<Term path="serviceEpisode" />** is created for the client under the requested service
3. If a team member is allocated:
   - The <Term path="caseWorker" /> is **assigned to the service episode**
   - A **"<Term path="referral" /> and Service Enrolment"** <Term path="activity" /> is auto-created within the episode containing:
     - <Term path="referral" /> summary and reference number
     - Service name and details
     - Staff assignment information
     - Any notes provided by the supervisor
   - The <Term path="caseWorker" /> sees this episode on their dashboard immediately
4. The <Term path="referral" /> progresses to active service delivery

### What Happens on Reject

1. Service request status changes to **Rejected** with the reason recorded
2. The <Term path="referral" /> status reverts to **Pending Service Dispatch**
3. The <Term path="referral" /> goes back to the dispatch queue where a new service can be selected
4. A new service request must be created before the <Term path="referral" /> can be sent to a supervisor again
