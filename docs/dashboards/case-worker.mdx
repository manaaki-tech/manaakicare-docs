# Case Worker Dashboard

The Case Worker Dashboard — titled **"My Caseload"** — is your personal hub for managing assigned service episodes and tracking activities that need follow-up. It gives you a focused view of your own workload.

## Overview

![Case Worker Dashboard Analytics](/case_worker/dashboard/analytic.png)

The dashboard displays:
- **Real-time metrics** showing your active cases, urgent items, follow-ups, and referral counts
- **My Active Cases** table of all service episodes assigned to you
- **Activities Needing Follow-up** table of scheduled follow-ups sorted by date and priority

The dashboard description reads: *"View and manage your assigned service episodes and activities."*

---

## Analytics Section

The top section displays four metric cards summarising your current workload.

### Statistics Cards

| Card | Icon | Description | Highlight Colour |
|------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Active Cases** | Document | Number of active service episodes assigned to you | Blue when you have active cases |
| **Urgent/Crisis** | Warning triangle | Combined count of urgent, crisis, and emergency priority referrals | Orange when count is greater than 0 |
| **Follow-ups Due** | Calendar | Number of activities with scheduled follow-up dates | Yellow when follow-ups are pending |
| **Total Referrals** | Activity | Total number of referrals across all priority levels | Default (no highlight) |

### Understanding the Numbers

- **Active Cases** reflects your current service episode assignments
- **Urgent/Crisis** sums up urgent + crisis + emergency priority referrals — check these first
- **Follow-ups Due** counts activities where you have set a follow-up date that still needs action
- **Total Referrals** shows your overall referral volume across all priorities (routine, priority, urgent, crisis, emergency)
