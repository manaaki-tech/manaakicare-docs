# Design System Showcase

This page demonstrates the full earthy palette implementation in the documentation theme.

## Earthy Color Palette

ManaakiCare uses a warm, earthy color palette inspired by New Zealand's natural landscapes:

- **Terracotta** (35°) - Critical, urgent, medical alerts
- **Amber** (75°) - Warnings, high priority items
- **Stone** (70°) - Neutral elements, inactive states
- **Sage** (145°) - Success, active states, primary actions
- **Teal** (195°) - Informational content, assessments
- **Olive** (115°) - Medium priority, on-hold states
- **Brown** (55°) - Referrals, pending items

## Standard Admonitions

Built-in Docusaurus admonitions now use our palette:

:::note Information
This is a **note** admonition using Teal from the earthy palette. Use for general information and tips.
:::

:::tip Success
This is a **tip** admonition using Sage green. Use for helpful suggestions and best practices.
:::

:::warning Caution
This is a **warning** admonition using Amber. Use for important warnings and gotchas.
:::

:::danger Critical
This is a **danger** admonition using Terracotta. Use for critical errors and security warnings.
:::

## Custom Callout Components

Use the `<Callout>` component for more flexible, color-coded content blocks:

<Callout color="teal" title="Assessment Information">
Use **Teal** callouts for assessment-related information, helpful tips, or general guidance.
</Callout>

<Callout color="sage" title="Active Status">
Use **Sage** callouts for success messages, active states, or positive confirmations.
</Callout>

<Callout color="amber" title="High Priority">
Use **Amber** callouts for warnings, high-priority items, or time-sensitive information.
</Callout>

<Callout color="terracotta" title="Urgent Medical Alert">
Use **Terracotta** callouts for critical alerts, urgent medical information, or errors.
</Callout>

<Callout color="olive" title="On-Hold Process">
Use **Olive** callouts for medium-priority items, on-hold processes, or coordination notes.
</Callout>

<Callout color="brown" title="Referral Process">
Use **Brown** callouts for referral information, pending items, or intake processes.
</Callout>

<Callout color="stone" title="Administrative Note">
Use **Stone** callouts for neutral information, administrative notes, or general context.
</Callout>

## Table Styling

Tables now feature Stone-colored headers with alternating row backgrounds and Sage hover states:

| Priority Level | Color | Use Case | Example |
|---------------|-------|----------|---------|
| Critical | Terracotta | Medical emergencies, urgent alerts | Hospital admission required |
| High | Amber | Time-sensitive tasks, warnings | Follow-up needed within 24h |
| Medium | Olive | Standard priority, coordination | Schedule monthly check-in |
| Low | Stone | Administrative, inactive | File archived |
| Active | Sage | Success states, completions | Service episode approved |
| Assessment | Teal | Information gathering | Initial assessment pending |
| Referral | Brown | Intake processes | New referral received |

## Usage in MDX Files

### Standard Admonitions

```markdown
:::note
Your information content here
:::

:::tip
Your success content here
:::

:::warning
Your warning content here
:::

:::danger
Your critical content here
:::
```

### Custom Callouts

```jsx
<Callout color="teal" title="Optional Title">
Your content here with **markdown** support
</Callout>

<Callout color="amber">
Content without a title
</Callout>
```

## Color Accessibility

All color combinations in the palette meet WCAG AA contrast standards:

- Light mode: Dark text on light backgrounds
- Dark mode: Light text on dark backgrounds
- Border accents provide additional visual differentiation
- Hover states enhance interactivity

## Implementation Notes

The design system is implemented through:

1. **OKLCH Color Space** - Perceptually uniform colors with consistent lightness
2. **CSS Custom Properties** - All colors defined as CSS variables in `custom.css`
3. **Automatic Dark Mode** - Inverted lightness values for dark theme
4. **Semantic Naming** - Color names reflect their purpose in the application

This ensures consistency between the documentation site and the ManaakiCare application frontend.
